# CITA WebSky Postprocessing
Some tests and postprocessing on the CITA mocks: produce moving lens maps, kSZ reconstruction, maybe more later.

CITA mocks are at [https://mocks.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/WebSky_Extragalactic_CMB_Mocks](https://mocks.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/WebSky_Extragalactic_CMB_Mocks).
The lensed alm, tsz, kSZ, and patchy kSZ maps should be downloaded along with the halo catalog.
